                                          I will try to make this as short as possible. I never liked reading long whitepapers. I believe this project is very easy to understand in less than 5 minutes. Also, the most important feature in any project, meaning the utility of the project is very clear and obvious. I think it's not even worth mentioning the gaming industry money numbers.

In other words, it will be a software that is similar to Steam + Twitch + sports betting, all in one. Plus a section for tournaments, championships and all kinds of events that users can vote for or propose and be involved directly. This will be a place where any small game developer can add their game, as an individual, without having a company, and also make money out of it. And the people who play multiplayer games have the option to play and also make money every day, no matter if there’s a championship or not.

It will also generate income/tokens for the game owner, from the total fees produced by the games owned.

It will support any games, (not games based on luck like casino games) from chess to 3d shooters, we will start with the most popular titles like (CS, Battlefield, FarCry), strategy (Age of Empires titles, Starcraft, C&C, Warcraft), racing games and generally all most popular multiplayer games. Console and Android games will not be supported. You will be able to bet on the result of that game/race/battle. The platform will use its own game credits/tokens (called GCO). The betting tokens are based on Ethereum blockchain, which you can use to bet on this platform or exchange back to any crypto. I will not get into technical features, as this step took us 2 years to develop. It will also be for viewers. Viewers mode means when you only prefer to watch live streaming games, and you will also be able to bet on the result of that game against other viewers.

For those like me who are bad at math, roughly speaking as an example, at a price of the ETH of 2000$, 1 GCO will be around 1$ during the ICO, and after the ICO ends it will be 5$.

                                          After launch, the platform will use a 5% fee, meaning if 2 players bet 50 tokens each on a game, the winner will only get 95 because 5% will go to the company and independent game developers as fees. All players in a multiplayer game can place bets. Also the viewers can bet, if the game is live streamed, and the players for example playing a racing game, will also earn a 5% percent from the total sum of the bets placed by the viewers. Meaning in this case, from the total bets of 100 GCO, 5 GCO will go to the platform as fees, and 5 GCO will go to the winner as earnings besides the bet.

I stand by paying people as much as I can, not as low as I can. Before I retired I was one of the founders of a non-profit organization that promotes and teaches conscious capitalism. Reminding people to think besides profits also at the health of their employees and the health of this planet. I understand a company needs profits to exist and evolve, but let's not limit ourselves only to that purpose. All the sponsorships that this company will make if this will be a success, will go to those types of NGO’s. Advertising will start only on the 1st of December.

Because at first the conclusion was that it can't be done. Both technically and legally. Then, because my main business is an offshore consulting agency, by mistake or luck I found a way to do this. I don’t have a team because I never associate and I never hire people or teams. I prefer to hire companies to do my work, contract based, because I don’t want to deal with employees, as companies respect deadlines or pay penalties. Main reason is if something goes wrong, an employee can not pay the damages, but a big company under a good contract can afford to take this responsibility. I prefer to pay more but work like this. I believe I'm faster and more efficient.

                                          Why am I doing the ICO if I can afford to do this myself? Short answer: because I don’t afford to do it fast enough. If I do it alone it will take me 2 years to build everything at my current income stream. Therefore I risk competition from those who have more money to do it faster. However, not very likely, but I prefer not to take the risk and sell something in order to have the budget to directly buy the tools I need, and also parts of the software, instead of doing it from the ground up. Also this will significantly reduce the time until the company will start making profits and sales. Estimated time is reduced at 1 year including testing. My current company is based in the European Union and will always be. In case you wonder whose name this company will be, as the EU laws make this public, well, as I just said I am an offshore companies expert. The company will be owned by another company that belongs to me, but from a country where company owners are not public.

Please always read the domain carefully as this type of scams where a letter or termination is changed are the most common. We will never contact you by email or send any unrequested emails.
